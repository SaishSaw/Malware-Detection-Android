# ABSTRACT

With increase in rapid technological advancements every year, security has become a growing concern. Technologies has increased the productivity tremendously, however it has also brought in new challenges for humanity to face.
A major issue in this tech driven world is cybercrimes. Cybercrimes is criminal activity which targets or uses a computer, computer networks or network devices.
This threat is concerning for users, computer systems and stakeholders. Malicious software also known as malware are evolving as major threat today. A malware consists of code, scripts, active content or intrusive software which intents to destroy the computer system, mobile apps or cause harm to the system. Malware is not restricted computer these days. A large number of Malware has been discovered in the past few decades including The Morris Worm, ILOVEYOU, Melissa, Code Red, Sasser, Nimda, Slammer, Welchia, Commwarrior-A, Stuxnet, and CryptoLocker, and the creation of these viruses also mutated based on technological development.
Number of algorithms are available to detect malware present in the application. These algorithms utilized concepts like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. In this study we have emphasized on creating light weight Machine Learning models. Methods of feature selection are as simple and efficient. The dimensions are reduced by nearly 76% of original dimensions. These models help in maintaining the security and safety of android devices. We have obtained AUC-score of 99.27% and recall score of 97.6%. Our study suggests that adopting advanced techniques like Machine Learning can provide significant help in malware detection.

# INTRODUCTION

Android is one of the most popular operating system. Nearly 70% of smartphone users have android OS. The open source nature of Android Operating System has attracted wider adoption of system with large number of developers. Development of Android devices has resulted in increase of malware attacks Android Operating smartphones. In recent years, a wide range of research are conducted on malware analysis and detection for Android devices. Android has also implemented various security controls for dealing with malware. Although the attack can be conducted through various means, attack through malware apps is most popular among the attackers. The malware apps can breach through the security layer of android and result in loss of data and help the third-party person to access the user credentials and other confidential information which can be misused. The following project work is developing of Machine Learning model which helps in detection of such malicious behaviour of apk.
Cybercrimes are rapidly increasing on Android-based devices because of their wide range usage. This has made it possible for hackers to engineer malicious applications and deploy within the system. This malicious applications can be classified using machine learning models is stated in Sharma et al.(2020).[1]
The article of Jiang et al.(2020)[2] states that the permissions that are frequently used by malicious application and identify these permissions as dangerous fine-grained permissions. These permissions are better differentiator of malicious and benign applications.
Wen et al(2017)[3] used a combination of features both static and dynamic analysis, then apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality of data and then apply different algorithms like SVM for classifying benign and malware classes. A feature extraction module that are used in performing static analysis to map API call to certain features. This is followed by feature vectors generation and dimensionality reduction. The classification algorithms are then followed for differentiation between benign and malicious apps.
The traditional techniques like signature based techniques are proving to be inefficient. Signature is a unique identifier for specific type of malware and it consists of various elements like hashes, strings, file size and various other identifying characteristics. Whenever there is a malware, the antivirus compares the characteristics with that of signature in database. In-case of malware activity detected that application is removed or quarantine from the system. However signature based approach has limitations like it cannot detect new variants of malicious or existing variants of malicious software. This is also accompanied by high false alarms when legitimate traffic is very high. Thus machine learning and AI based malware detection techniques are now on top(Christiana et al.2020).[4]
Threat Intelligence Report created by Nokia in 2019 Android devices were most affected by malware infections with a percentage of 47.15% of the total cases; Windows and personal computers came next at 35.82%, followed by IoT devices with 16.17%.iPhones attributed for less than 1% of the total attacks. In fact, a 31% increase was seen in the number of attacks on Android devices from 2017 to 2018.[5]
Wei, Xuetao, et al[6] (2012 IEEE 28th International Conference on Data Engineering Workshops, April 2012, pp. 251–254.) bring to light that android malware can even affect enterprises by causing losses in data integrity, enterprise data-and hence, competitional advantage and consequently, monetary loss.
S. Hou et al. [7] proposed a deep belief network based Android malware detection system DroidDelver. They performs feature engineering on API calls by categorizing it into blocks and employs deep learning techniques to classify it.
Researchers have also performed investigation upon APK files by extracting permissions and API calls as a feature set. Chan et al. [8] obtain an accuracy rate of more than 90% using this method. This research has been extended by Peiravian et al. [9] to implement machine learning models with improved accuracy of 94.9%. 

# METHODOLOGIES
## •	DATASETS

The datasets used for this models are Drebin and Naticus. Drebin dataset includes features like API-Signature, android Permission, Intent actions and hardware permission. All these feature values are binary variable(0 or 1).There are 216 such features for each sample. This dataset contains samples collected from different devices which contains 11,120 samples.
Naticus dataset includes feature like android permission which is collected on different devices. The features are binary variables. There 87 such features for each app sample. This dataset contains 29,333 samples.
Each of these datasets contains target columns where apps are classified as malware and benign. 
After importing the datasets further steps were followed which includes understanding the dimensions of data, data types of features present and basic summaries of all the features.
Further we checked for null values present in the datasets. We imputed the features with suitable strategy. The datasets were divided into train and test sets with 70:30 ratio. Different models are implemented on train sets. Gridsearch CV is used for selecting the best hyper-parameters.

## •	FEATURE SELECTION & MODEL BUILDING

Features used for building our final models were extracted using feature selection techniques with Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost Classifier. Both datasets are trained on entire feature sets. Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost were constructed on entire training set with all the features. Using important features attribute we created a set of features with high feature scores. This set of features were then trained various models Adaboost, Decision tree, Random Forest, XGboost and logistic regression. The metrics were evaluated for each model on both train and test set. Learning curve was plotted to understand the model’s performance as number of features increases. 

# CONCLUSION
This helped us in finalizing the optimal set of features. For drebin dataset we finalized 50 features and for naticus dataset, 45 features were finalized.
After interprating feature score we reduced the features set to top 12 features for model training and analysed the result. This projects helps in understanding of ML in cybersecurity space.
